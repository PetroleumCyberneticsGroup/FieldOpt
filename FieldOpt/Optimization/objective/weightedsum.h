 * \brief The WeightedSum class defines the objectuve function for the optimization
 * on the following form for \f$ n \f$ components:
 * \f[
 *      f = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \gamma_i \times k_i
 * \f]
 * where \f$\gamma_i\f$ is some factor \f$ \left< -\infty, \infty \right> \f$, for example 1 or -1,
 * and \f$ k \f$ is some keyword defining either a property in the simulator summary or some predefined
 * compound expression. Both \f$ \gamma \f$ and \f$ k \f$ must be defined for all components of the
 * objective function.
 *
 * Example:
 * \f[
 *      f = 1.0 \times CUMOIL - 0.9 \times CUMWAT
 * \f]
 * where \f$ CUMOIL \f$ \f$ CUMWAT \f$ are the keywords for the cumulative oil production and cumulative
 * water production in the summary, respectively.
