         * some classical and modern methods (DOI: 10.1137/S003614450242889)
         *
         * This implementation also borrows some from the Kolda's 2005 paper on
         * the Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search (APPS) (DOI: 0.1137/040603589)
         * in that it allows for multiple current step lengths (e.g. one per search
         * direction). This is to allow for more flexibility in the implementation
         * of specific algorithms (e.g. APPS).
         *
         * @note that this is an abstract class. It must be extended by some other
         * class (e.g. like the CompassSearch class) to provide specific patterns
         * and contraction/expansion parameter values.
